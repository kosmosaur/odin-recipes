    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A Turkish cousin to breakfast classic <em>shakshouka</em>, <em>menemen</em> also features a tomato sauce with peppers. But instead of poaching, the eggs are scrambled into the sauce with plenty of cheese, creating the perfect gooey accompaniment to some crisp bread and of course, Turkish coffee.</p>
    <p>This dish is fine with bell pepper, but to get more heat and a better flavor, I recommend adding at least a jalapeno, if not a couple serrano peppers. Live a little.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients (serves 1)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>3-4 small roma tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>Chilis to taste (I prefer 3-4 serranos and some green bell)</li>
