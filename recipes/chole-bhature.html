        <li>Place frying oil into pot over high heat</li>
        <li>Place into hot oil and watch the bhature puff like a balloon!</li>
        <li>fry until golden brown (about 1 minute per side)</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
        <li>Add chickpeas with chickpea water, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods and tea bag to a pot</li>
        <li>Simmer until chickpeas are soft enough to squish between fingers, then remove from heat</li>
        <li>While chickpeas simmer, to hot oil in a large frypan add cinnamon stick, jeera seeds, and cardamom pods</li>
        <li>Once fragrant add garlic and ginger paste</li>
