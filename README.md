Three recipes presented by Kosmosaur

In this project I will be creating a website with three pages each detailing a separate recipe. 

The new skills I have demonstrated include the following:
- Version control using git
- HTML document creation
- Writing concise commit messages
- Managing images and assets
TODO: finish list of skills
